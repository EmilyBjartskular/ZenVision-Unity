# ZenVision
The purpose of this project was an assignment for the course M7012E at LTU (Lule√• Tekniska Universitet) to design a pervasive system. The decision was to create an app that Visualizes sensors in a smart home environment. Using the Hololens 2, user is able to interact and display sensors in the environment in real time. Three services was designed to facilitate the app. An (API)[https://github.com/EmilyBjartskular/ZenVision-API] that keeps takes the data from a Fibaro home center 3 System. A (store app)[https://github.com/EmilyBjartskular/ZenVision-Store] that keeps context of spacial anchor and the main app in unity. Services was facilitated to add and remove sensor in the environment and ability (if user input was correct) get data in real time.
## Project Ideas

1. Precense detection for sensor activation along with sensor visualization with a Microsoft Hololens
